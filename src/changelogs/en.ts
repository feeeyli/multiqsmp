  '3.0': `# Customizable layout
  Streams are now arranged in a layout where you can enlarge, shrink and move them as you wish, with the added bonus of not having to limit yourself to the size of the screen.

  Chats can also have the same behavior, but this must be enabled in the settings.

  # Swap points
  You can now move streams around as you wish and create swap points in up to 4 of these streams.
  
  With these points you can quickly swap 2 streams, just by clicking on the corresponding swap button. Here's an example of what you can do:

  Swap points must be enabled in the settings.

  # New organization menu
  
  The menu for organizing streams has now become more useful. Here you can see all the streamers and groups (and streamers from groups) that you have chosen.
  
  You can also enable or disable chats and hide streamers from groups, which you can still do by changing the URL directly (e.g. group.-streamer).

  # Search by streamers
  
  The selection menu has been made more complete, with an improved search bar that makes it possible to search for streamers directly from Twitch, even if they are not in QSMP. To search from Twitch, simply change the search mode by clicking on the globe button next to the search bar.
  
  The streamers you search for can be pinned, being shown just above the standard QSMP streamers. In addition, streamers from outside the QSMP, placed directly in the URL, are now also shown in the selection, with the possibility of pinning them.
  
  ![Search by streamers](/changelogs/3.0/streamers-search.png "Search by streamers")`,
  '3.1': `# Hide Group Members
  When right-clicking on a group in the seletor dialog, a menu will appear where you can hide group members before making your selection. After hiding the members you want, click the "Select" button to confirm, or click outside the menu to cancel.
  
  On touch screens, simply hold down the group you want, and the menu will appear.

  # Pre-defined Layouts
  Click the Layouts button on the side to open a menu where you'll have 4 options:
  
  - Reset
  - 1 focus
  - 2 focuses
  - 4 focuses
  
  "Reset" will clear any modifications made to the layout.
  
  The focus buttons will modify the layout to a predefined arrangement and add swap points to the focuses.
